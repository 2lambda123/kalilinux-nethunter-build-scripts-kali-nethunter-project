# Kali NetHunter Installer

The [Kali NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-mobile) installer is basically just a zip file generated by `build.py` from the folder layout contained here.

Follow the instructions below to create the installer zip.

All you have to do is flash it through **TWRP** for a complete Kali NetHunter environment and chroot on your device.

The boot image patching script is based on [LazyFlasher](https://github.com/jcadduono/lazyflasher)'s kernel-flasher branch.

## Instructions

### Preparing the environment

Before building, you will need to initialize the [devices repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices).

The whole setup has been automated. As Kali NetHunter devices have an immense binary Git history, we suggest using shallow clone _(`--depth 1`)_, rather than **full history** when prompt:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

### Build command examples

Example building for the **Nexus 5 (hammerhead)**:

```bash
python build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow
```

- - -

Building the **kernel only** _(useful for testing if kernel works)_:

```bash
python build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow -k
```

- - -

Building **without the kernel** _(useful for just updating apps)_:

```bash
python build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow -nk
```

- - -

Building with **adding a full chroot** _(add `kalifs-full.tar.xz` to `rootfs/[arch]/kalifs-full.tar.xz`):_

```bash
python build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow --rootfs full
```

- - -

Create a **release version**:

```bash
python build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow --rootfs full --release v3.0
```

- - -

Force **download all third party apps**:

```bash
python build.py --forcedown
```

- - -

Building the **uninstaller**:

```bash
python build.py --uninstaller
```

- - -

Show **help**:

```bash
python build.py -h
```
